*   #### Usage-based pricing
    
    We will only charge you for the resources you consume within the platform. Common resource metrics might include the amount of CPU and memory allocated, and storage usage, but we will never charge you for the amount of users or namespaces created. Users are billed according to their actual usage, which can be a flexible and cost-effective option.
    
*   #### Pay-as-you-go
    
    We offer a pay-as-you-go pricing model, similar to cloud computing services. Users are billed for the resources they consume on an hourly or monthly basis. This model provides flexibility, as you only pay for what you use, but costs can vary based on usage.
